# Election-map-of-Wyomin
This project is to create maps showing statistics of votes in the state of Wyoming in 2016 presidential election by using **R** and **Shiny**. The online version of the maps is available at [https://huifenzhou.shinyapps.io/project](https://huifenzhou.shinyapps.io/project).

The voting results are **visualized** so that viewers can get the details by hovering over each county. Below is an example.
